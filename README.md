# Rice Seed Classification and Quality Evaluation Using Image Data

Rice is one of the most widely produced grain products worldwide, with numerous genetic varieties that differ in characteristics such as texture, shape, and color. These features play a crucial role in distinguishing rice varieties and assessing seed quality. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify and evaluate the quality of five different rice varieties: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag, based on image data.

The dataset contains 75,000 grain images, with 15,000 images per variety. Using this dataset, the task is to build a model that can accurately classify rice varieties based on their distinguishing features, which will help in automated quality control and identification in the agricultural industry.
